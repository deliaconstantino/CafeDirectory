# CAFE DIRECTORY

This is a simple content management system using Ruby on Rails to manage user generated content on cafes and coffeeshops. Users can:

- create an account via the app or log in with their Google account

- view the user generated cafe directory

- add cafes to the cafe directory

- update existing cafes in the directory

- search cafes by state or keyword

- view the current most highly rated cafe (by average rating)

- create, edit, and delete their own cafe reviews

- view other users' cafe reviews


# How to get started:

- clone this repo down to your local environment

- run `rails db:migrate`

- run `rails db:seed`

- start the Rails server and head to `localhost:3000` to see the app in your browser

- add to the Cafe Directory!
